# Tank Stars Game Clone

## Overview
This project is a clone of the popular Tank Stars game, developed using the LibGDX framework in Java. The clone aims to replicate the core gameplay mechanics and features of the original game while applying various object-oriented programming principles.

## Framework
- **LibGDX:** The game is built using LibGDX, a cross-platform Java framework for developing games. LibGDX provides a robust set of tools and libraries for 2D and 3D game development.

## Features
- **Gameplay:** Classic turn-based tank battles with varying weapons and terrain.
- **User Interface:** Intuitive controls and interactive UI elements.
- **Physics:** Realistic projectile physics and collision detection.

## UML Diagram
The UML diagram for the game classes is available. The diagram illustrates the design and relationships between the key classes in the game, including tanks, projectiles, and game state management.

## Object-Oriented Programming Principles
The following object-oriented programming principles have been applied in the development of this project:
- **Encapsulation:** Classes are designed to encapsulate their data and behavior, providing clear interfaces for interaction.
- **Inheritance:** Common functionality is abstracted into base classes, with specific implementations extending these classes.
- **Polymorphism:** Methods are overridden to provide specific behavior for different types of game objects.
- **Abstraction:** Abstract classes and interfaces are used to define common behaviors and interactions, simplifying the game design.
